# Highschool C# projects

I'm not sure if all of these work anymore, I think there are a few that are broken.

# Installation:

1. Download and install Visual Studio
2. Clone this repository somewhere you wont forget
3. Import one of these projects as a project file
4. Hopefully, you will be able to run them
